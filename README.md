# Saliency-detection
Saliency detection in pixel level using CNN with dilated convolutions
it is a Tensorflow class of a convolutional neural network for saliency detection task in pixel level.
The designed network has fully convolutional architecture which consists of a encoder and decoder part. This network uses Pyramid pooling as described in Deeplab 3.
One of the main features of provided class in this project is having many features from simple network creation to traing and network optimization for deployment which can be used as the structure in tensorflow 1 projects.
